CAI Webcontrol Perl Modules
by James Golovich <james@gnuinter.net>

If anyone ever uses these I'll consider putting them on CPAN when it gets more advanced.

Supports:
Variable subsition in PLC code
Generating RRD graphs
Upload PLC code

I use these devices for my fermenter glycol chiller controller and walk in cooler.  Example code can be found in samplecode


The latest release should be available at http://webcontrol.gnuinter.net

To install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make all
	make install
