I am not aware of another list of changes between each version of CAI 
Networks Webcontrol firmware, so I'm going to try to keep track here.  As 
I discover them I'll update this file

03.02.11 Released around 12/19/2011
	Added UROM1..4 Variables that are setable via web interface and persist across reboots
	Added CTS code which is seconds since (3/22/2000?), useful for PLC code to only execute an action after a certain amount of time has passed

03.02.09
