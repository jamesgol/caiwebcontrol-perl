Firmware 03.02.11 reports firmware version as "v3.02.11" in getall.cgi where firmware 03.02.09 reports it as "3.02.09".  
I can deal with the change but consistency is nice, I'm planning on using this data to make sure my code communicates with the board
properly
<firmware>3.02.09</firmware>
<firmware>v03.02.11</firmware>

Firmware 03.02.11 NetDevAPI.js the comment describing the updated structure wasn't updated:
        /*data is encoded into the following structure
        struct
        {
                INT32 region_second_adj;
                BOOL ajax_polling;
                UINT8 pad; 
        }NVM_GENERAL_CONFIG; */


Page 22 manual: ..., "even the delay operator value is in unit of 1 mS.."  Should be "even though the delay operator is in units of 1mS."
